# TestProjects
Testing to see if github is easier for me to use for these test projects than gitlab.

# Problem set 2, question 1:
The way I want to approach this is by setting up a command that prompts the user for a variable name, called camelCase, and will end up outputting the variable's name in snake case instead of in camel case.
After that line I want to print out the snake case version of the camel case word, but I am making use of the 'end=""' argument to make sure that each changed letter goes to the end of the line instead of starting a new line. So that when the print command runs again it continues on the same line.
